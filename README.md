Model of Seed Transfer

Directories content
===================
- main directory : *.f90 source files, scripts, compiled and linked program
  - --------> cdflib library : see below
  - --------> modules : compiled *.mod files
  - --------> inputdata : input data files read by most execution
  - --------> outputdata : output data files with results of calculations


COMPILATION
===========
The program was developed on NIC4 Ceci Linux computer cluster of ULi√®ge : http://www.ceci-hpc.be/ using Intel Fortan v14 compiler

https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/compilers/fortran-compilers.html
Newer versions of the compiler should work but have not been tested.


CDFLIB Probability library
--------------------------
CDFLIB, a FORTRAN90 code which evaluates the cumulative density function (CDF) associated with common probability distributions, by Barry Brown, James Lovato, Kathy Russell.
Downloaded from https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/f_src/cdflib/cdflib.html

To compile the CDFLIB library and create the cdflib.a file place yourself in the cdflib subdirectory  and execute the script ./create_cdflib.sh
		

Main program compilation
------------------------
The cdflib.a file must exist in cdflib subdirectory.
The list of source files to be compiled is contained in "sourcesall.dat" file.
Place yourself in the main directory and execute the bash script ./compile.sh
The executable most.out will be created.

Main program execution
----------------------
Calculations parameter are located in parameters.dat file
./run.sh  calculates the month defined in parameters.dat
./run_all_months.sh calculates 12 months from jan. to dec.

MODULES
-------
- most.f90	      : main program
- mod_common.f90      : declaration of global variables
- mod_parameters.f90	: Reads values in parameter.dat and store them in common variables declared in mod_common.f90
- mod_groups.90		: Calculates and store an array of n weeks . Called by main program.
- mod_week.f90        : A week contains an array of 7 paths (days). Calls defecations routines to calculate and store defecation and spitted points.
- mod_path.f90		: object t_path contains an array of points for one day from wake-up to bed
- mod_geo.f90         : Geometric calculations
- mod_nest.f90		: sleeping sites (or nests) management
- mod_faidef.f90      : reads an array of 12 FAI_DEF values, one for each month. FAI_DEF is used in state calculations
- mod_daytime.f90     : reads an array of 12 month with mean SD values for normal distribution to calculate wake-up bed times
- mod_angle.f90       : calculates new angle following Von Mises distribution. Provides new angles to mod_point module.
- mod_step.f90		: calculates new steps following Gamma distribution. Provides new steps to mod_point module.
- mod_point.f90		: A point is the location where the monkey stops after one step. The module calculates points following random angles and step length and states.
- mod_pointpointer.f90: t_pointpointer objects contain point a index and various methods to manipulates points
- mod_trees.f90       : Module stores feeding areas read in input files depending on month. Used for defecation and points calculations
- mod_state.f90		: routines to calculate randomly new states used to create points
- mod_defecation.f90	: t_defecation class to store results of calculations made in mod_week.
- mod_transit.f90     : create randomized transit time following normal distribution used by defecation calculations
- mod_tools.f90       : utility functions to manipulates strings and file names
